Step 1: Create the folowing training datasets specific to an application:

1. Module List (Module_List.csv)
2. Module Mapping (Module_Mapping.csv)
3. Test Cases (Test_Cases.csv)
4. Release Data (Release_Data.csv)

* The template names and also the column headers must not be changed.

Step 2: Check-in the csv sheets in a folder.

Step 3: Create the input release sheet (Input_Release.csv) with the new release name, implementation date, release type and list of modules impacted.

*The template name and column headers must not be changed.

Step 4: The input release sheet to be checked in the same folder as the training csv files.

Step 5: Run the Python script (Data_PreProcessing.py) from command prompt as:

* If the training csv files and input release csv are available in the same folder as the Python script:

python Data_PreProcessing.py

* If the training csv files and input release csv are available in a different folder:

python Data_PreProcessing.py --Folder_path <<Training CSV path>>


Step 6: The output csv file will be generated in the same folder as the training data and input release csv.
